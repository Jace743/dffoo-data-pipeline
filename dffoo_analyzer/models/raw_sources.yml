              Some 'abilities' generated after/during scraping will not have IDs (e.g., 'Uncapped' followup attacks).

            description: The timestamp in UTC at which the web scraper instance that generated this row started running.

          - name: timing
            description: >
              Indicates when the followup attack occurs -- during the attack (included in launch bonus),
              before the attack (not included in launch bonus), or after the attack (also not included in launch bonus).
              Technically, "followup" can be a misnomer, since these abilities can also be preemptives (e.g., Reks' Remove Obstacle).

          - name: triggers
            description: >
              Indicates what triggers the followup ability described in this row. Might be a list of abilties,
              a single ability, or a single string that describes a certain behavior.

              field_action: Occurs based on any field turns passing.
              damaging: Occurs when the character with the followup uses a damage-dealing ability.
              effect: Currently a catch-all label for follow-ups that don't do any damage.
              all: Occurs when the character takes a turn, regardless of whether they deal damage.
              ally_attack: Occurs when an ally other than the character takes a turn.
              airborne: Label for dragoon attacks that occur only while they're in the air (Kain and Freya).

          - name: default
            description: >
              Indicates whether the follow up occurs without requiring any extra conditions (T) or not (F).
              For example, if a character only gains the follow up once their BT is active, the value should be F for this column.

          - name: during_bt
            description: >
              Indicates whether the follow up occurs while the character's BT effect is active (T). Note that just because the follow up
              occurs during their BT (T) doesn't mean that it occurs EXCLUSIVELY during their BT. Most characters whose follow ups occur
              outside of their BT effect will still have a T value for this column. Some characters, however, have follow ups that change
              when their BT effect is or is not active (Raines, Amarant).

          - name: double_during_bt
            description: >
              Indicates whether the character's follow up ability triggers twice during their BT effect instead of once.
